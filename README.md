# Pose Estimator Library

**This repository contains a custom library for [Processing](https://processing.org), giving it the ability to detect the location of human figures in images and videos. The library also includes a complete Digital Musical Instrument created as a Processing sketch, which uses the aforementioned library.**

The pose estimation is accomplished using the [TensorFlow Java framework](https://github.com/tensorflow/java), and a publicly available deep learning model from [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose).

The library and instrument formed the final project for my degree in Creative Computing at the University of London.
